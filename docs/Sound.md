# Sound: ambient track and settings getters

`src/sound/` reconstructs eight functions (536 executable bytes) from the pinned
GR8E69 executable, all from the original `sound.cpp` (file record 1378). Claude Code
assisted the analysis and verification. Private `sound.cpp` storage and the private
`err` helper stay external original context.

| Manifest | Functions | Code bytes | Generated data |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `sound_getters` | `SoundGetVolumes`, `SoundGetOneShotBankID`, `SoundGetAmbientTrackEvent`, `SoundGetMusicEventID` | 92 | None |
| `ambient_track` | `AmbientTrack_Start` (private), `AmbientTrack_Select`, `AmbientTrack_Volume` | 320 | 144 bytes at `0x802a9bc4` |
| `ambient_track_location` | `AmbientTrack_SetLocation` | 124 | 4 bytes at `0x802a9c90` |

## Behavior

- `SoundGetVolumes` copies `g_sfxVolume` and `g_musicVolume` unless the global
  `g_bDisableSound` is set. The other getters copy `g_OneShotBankID`, the ambient
  event's current track (`+0x48`) and the global `gMusicCurEvent`.
- One ambient stream is driven through the private 76-byte `gAmbientTrackEvent`
  (`AmbientStreamSoundEvent`) and its handle `g_hAmbientTrack`; -12 means no stream.
- `AmbientTrack_Start` clears the event's word at `+0x24`, sets the float at `+0x28`
  to 0 and both halfwords at `+0x3c`/`+0x3e` to 70, then calls `SendEvent`. A
  negative result prints the original error through `err` and `DebugMsg` and stores
  -12.
- `AmbientTrack_Select(track)` stores the requested track at `+0x44`; without a
  stream it starts one, otherwise it calls `UpdateEvent(handle, 1)` only when the
  track differs from the current one.
- `AmbientTrack_Volume` stores the volume at `+0x34` while a stream exists.
- `AmbientTrack_SetLocation(position)` sets `g_ambientSourceOnPlayer` when the
  position is null; otherwise it copies the position into the 16-byte
  `g_ambientSourcePos` (a `CVector3`).

`include/game/SoundAmbience.h` is a member-only view of the event: it names the
touched fields and the two methods, and declares no table pointer or base class.

The `.rodata` between the two fragments holds an `AmbientTrack_Stop(): EndEvent()
FAILED` message. No `AmbientTrack_Stop` code exists in the executable; it is left as
original context rather than given an invented body.

## Verification

ProDG 3.8.1 with `-O2 -G0 -fno-exceptions -fno-implicit-templates` reproduces every
fragment and its strings and constants. The complete rebuilt analysis image is
identical. Runtime behavior has not been tested.
